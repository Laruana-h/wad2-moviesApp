# Assignment 1 - Agile Software Practice.

## Automated Testing.

### Best test cases.

[ List the top 4/5 test cases ('it' blocks), in your opinion, from your test suite that best demonstrate your competency in writing Cypress test code. Specify the test file name and the starting line number of the 'it' block, 

e.g.
+ cypress/integration/mustWatch-movies-page.spec.js - line 24
+ cypress/integration/actor-bio-page.spec.js - line 32
+ etc

### Cypress Custom commands (if relevant).

[Specify the test file(s) that contain custom Cypress command implementations.]

+ cypress/integration/mustWatch-novies-page.spec.js
+ cypress/integration/actor-bio-page.spec.js

## Code Splitting.
